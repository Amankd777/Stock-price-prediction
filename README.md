## Introduction

This repository hosts a collection of Jupyter Notebook files that leverage AI techniques for stock market analysis. From predicting stock prices to recommending stocks based on news sentiment and identifying candlestick patterns through images, this project showcases various applications of AI in the realm of stocks.

## Stock Prediction using Stacked LSTM

The `Stock_prediction_using_LSTM.ipynb` notebook employs Stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict stock prices. It utilizes historical stock data for training and evaluation.

## Stock Recommendation through News Sentiment Analysis

In the `Stock_recommendation.ipynb` notebook, news sentiment analysis is used to recommend stocks based on the sentiment of news articles related to companies.

## Candlestick Pattern Prediction through CNN

The `Candlestick pattern recognition.ipynb` notebook utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict candlestick patterns based on manually created image datasets.

## Data Sources

The project uses scraped stock market data from Yahoo Finance and manually created image datasets for candlestick pattern prediction.

## Usage

1. Open the desired Jupyter Notebook file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Follow the instructions in each notebook to run, train, and analyze the respective models.
